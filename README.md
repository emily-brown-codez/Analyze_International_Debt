# Analyze_International_Debt
Analyze_International_Debt SQL

 - In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank.  The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.  These are a few questions I explored:
    - What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
    - Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
    - What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?


 - Setup: To run the following application, you would need these prerequisites.
     - Jupyter Notebook
     - Python 3.7.X

     
 - The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.
